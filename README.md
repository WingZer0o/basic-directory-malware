# basic-directory-malware

This repository is for educational purposes only and as such as been licensed as MIT. I do not promote the usage of unethical usage. This is a very basic malware that will encrypt a target directory and send the encrypted files to an API. Where the API decrypts using the same AES-256-CBC key so the attacker can view the files after the malware has encrypted and left them on the encrypted on the affected machine. The AES key is derived from a shared secret that is produced using Diffie Hellman using x25519 the nonce takes the first 96 bit of the generated shared secret.
